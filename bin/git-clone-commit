# Also, this does a subset of the functionality of chj-checkout, but,
# it's detangled for that reason. D'oh. :

# 1. *Just* clones the repo and sets it to a specific commit
# 2. *Just* assumes that the name git_clone_commit is still free (well
#    it is given that 1 already assumed that it is being cloned freshly.

# No tag verification, trusting sha1.
